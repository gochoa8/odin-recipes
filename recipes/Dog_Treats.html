    <h2>Chicken liver cookies</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200 grams chicken livers</li>
        <li>80 ml (one third cup) milk</li>
        <li>1 eggs</li>
        <li>100 grams semolina</li>
        <li>100 grams wholemeal plain flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 150 degrees C.</li>
        <li>Clean and cut up livers. Without oil, stir-fry livers until they are dry. Transfer to a blender or food processor and blend well. Add milk and egg then blend well again.</li>
        <li>Place flour and semolina in a bowl. Add the liver “milk shake” mixture to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough is formed.</li>
        <li>Place dough on a well floured surface and knead lightly until it is no longer sticky. Roll out to a thickness of 5mm. Cut out your choice of shapes from the dough. I used a bone shaped cutter.</li>
        <li>Left over dough can be kneaded back together and re-rolled to cut more shapes out of.</li>
        <li>Place cookies on a lined baking tray and bake for approximately 30 minutes until cooked through. Remove from heat and leave to cool on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Cookies may be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 10 days. They may also be stored in the fridge or freezer up to 12 months.</li> 
    </ol>
